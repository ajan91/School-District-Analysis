# Deliverable 1: Replace Ninth-Grade Reading and Math Scores

"Using the Pandas loc method with conditional statements and comparison and logical operators, select the ninth-grade reading and math scores for Thomas High School. Then, use the Pandas NumPy module to change the reading and math scores to NaN."

The following are to illustrate the findings for the Deliberable 1 requirements. The instruction of each requirement is given with the corresponding illustration.

Deliverable 1. Requirement 1. "A comparison operator is used to retrieve all the rows with Thomas High School in the "school_name" column of the student_data_df"
Deliverable 1. Requirement 2. "A comparison operator is used to retrieve all the rows with the ninth grade in the "grade" column of the student_data_df"
